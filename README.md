# Change detection in remotely sensed images
## Analysis of clustering based solutions
Clustering-based change detection pipeline developed as thesis for my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science @ Aldo Moro - University of Bari, under the supervision of professor Annalisa Appice, member of Knowledge Discovery and Data Engineering research group.

Sorry for the lack of an English version of my thesis document. I'm planning to write a translated version soon.
