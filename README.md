# Change detection in remotely sensed images
## Analysis of clustering based solutions
Clustering-based change detection pipeline developed as thesis for my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science @ Aldo Moro - University of Bari, under the supervision of professor Annalisa Appice, member of Knowledge Discovery and Data Engineering research group.

Many thanks to: 
- my sister Giovanna for reviewing the document before submission. 
- Pietro La Selva for drawing the image ***Figura 1.1***

Sorry for the lack of an English version of my thesis document. I'm planning to write a translated version soon.
